# Homework #3: GUI Practice

This project (**CP2A**) is a direct continuation and enhancement of a previous course project, [cp1](https://github.com/imperionite/cp1), which served as the foundational phase for the MotorPH Employee Management System. The initial phase (cp1) focused on building a RESTful backend using Spring Boot and MySQL, implementing core payroll features such as:

- Employee information management
- Attendance tracking
- Automated payroll calculations
- Basic deductions and salary computation

The rationale, design decisions, and initial API documentation from **cp1** have been carried forward and expanded upon in this repository. Much of the documentation, architectural structure, and core modules in **CP2A** are derived from or inspired by the groundwork established in **cp1**. This ensures architectural consistency and provides a clear evolutionary path for the system.

The projects aims to satisfy the requirements stated in the [MotorPH's Change Requests Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHv2ht0gqcOINH_yn08s8NBn5DFM-7RIhZlnDWJyEpU/edit?usp=sharing):

All essential background, rationale, and initial API endpoint documentation are either included here or referenced directly from cp1 to avoid duplication and ensure clarity.

### Whatâ€™s New in This Project

- **Frontend Integration:** A new React frontend (in the `GUI` folder) using Vite, running independently and communicating with the backend via REST API and CORS.
- **Improved Modularity:** Backend and frontend are decoupled for easier deployment and scalability.
- **Updated Documentation:** Enhanced and updated documentation, with references to class diagrams ([see here](https://github.com/imperionite/cp2a/blob/main/CLASS_DIAGRAM.md)) and new features added in this phase.

## Initial GUI Screenshots

The GUI or the frontend of this app runs on port `5173` and consuming the REST API backend that runs on port `8080`.

1. **Authentication**: Login with `username` and `password`.

**Note**: Regarding the requirement for [MPHCR04](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHv2ht0gqcOINH_yn08s8NBn5DFM-7RIhZlnDWJyEpU/edit?gid=299960867#gid=299960867) features related to authentication, my prerequisite project in `CP 1` and this current project have `user authentication` enabled by default, along with other features, due to the design and development of the backend API of this app. Additionally, a simple implementation of role-based access control distinguishes between admin users and regular users or employees. To elaborate, although it was not my intention to implement this feature in advance without understanding the requirements of CP 2's project deliverable, but I am glad that I made the decision to do so before it was explicitly required.

2. **Logout**: User can logout from the app by clicking the Logout top header menu.

3. **Employees GUI: Admin User View**: This is the view displayed after an admin user is authenticated in the system and redirected to the Employees route. The permission to view this page depends on the logged-in user's is_admin status. Currently, there is only one established admin user in the system with the username admin for simplicity, and their is_admin value is set to true, while the rest are set to false.

4. **Employees GUI: Regular User View**: View after `regular user` authenticated in the system and redirected to `Employees` route.
