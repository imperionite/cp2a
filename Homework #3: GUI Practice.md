# Homework #3: GUI Practice

## Project Background & Lineage

This project (**CP2A**) is a direct continuation and enhancement of a previous course project, [cp1](https://github.com/imperionite/cp1), which served as the foundational phase for the MotorPH Employee Management System. The initial phase (cp1) focused on building a RESTful backend using Spring Boot and MySQL, implementing core payroll features such as:

- Employee information management
- Attendance tracking
- Automated payroll calculations
- Basic deductions and salary computation

The rationale, design decisions, and initial API documentation from **cp1** have been carried forward and expanded upon in this repository. Much of the documentation, architectural structure, and core modules in **CP2A** are derived from or inspired by the groundwork established in **cp1**. This ensures architectural consistency and provides a clear evolutionary path for the system.

**For detailed foundational documentation, refer to the [cp1 repository](https://github.com/imperionite/cp1).**  
All essential background, rationale, and initial API endpoint documentation are either included here or referenced directly from cp1 to avoid duplication and ensure clarity.

### Whatâ€™s New in This Project

- **Frontend Integration:** A new React frontend (in the `GUI` folder) using Vite, running independently and communicating with the backend via REST API and CORS.
- **Improved Modularity:** Backend and frontend are decoupled for easier deployment and scalability.
- **Updated Documentation:** Enhanced and updated documentation, with references to class diagrams ([see here](https://github.com/imperionite/cp2a/blob/main/CLASS_DIAGRAM.md)) and new features added in this phase.

## Initial Data Source and Application Setup

The initial data utilized by this application is sourced from the Google Sheets provided in the Phase 1 requirements instruction, accessible via this [link](https://sites.google.com/mmdc.mcl.edu.ph/motorph/home). Specifically, the [Employee](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1168Un_0b5CPDwDSOH4CWI1m8_-2LpLadX3wAdUNNFOo/edit?usp=sharing) database serves as the foundational dataset. The process of seeding data is accomplished through the use of the `ApplicationRunner`.

### Data Seeding and Initial Setup

The application uses an `ApplicationRunner` to seed the database with initial data. This ensures that the application has a basic set of employees and users to start with. The data is prepared in a multi-step process:

1.  **Google Sheets:** Employee and user data is initially sourced in Google Sheets for ease of collaboration and management.
2.  **CSV Export:** This data is then exported from Google Sheets in CSV (Comma Separated Value) format.
3.  **MySQL Import:** The CSV files are then used to populate the MySQL database during application startup using the `ApplicationRunner`. This automated process ensures that the database is consistently populated with the necessary data.

**Rationale:** This approach allows for a flexible and manageable way to maintain and update the initial data. Google Sheets provides a user-friendly interface for data entry and collaboration, while the CSV format serves as a reliable intermediate format for importing into the database. The `ApplicationRunner` automates the import process, ensuring data consistency and reducing manual effort.
