The MotorPH Employee Management System is a basic employee management application for the fictional organization MotorPH, built using Spring Boot, a user-friendly Java framework designed for web applications and RESTful APIs. It utilizes MySQL as its database management system, chosen for its reliability and performance.

This system allows users to log in and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. Using Spring Boot and a REST API architecture simplifies development and enhances scalability and management of employee data.

The projects aims to satisfy the requirements stated in the [MotorPH's Change Requests Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHv2ht0gqcOINH_yn08s8NBn5DFM-7RIhZlnDWJyEpU/edit?usp=sharing):

**Rationale for Technology Choices**

Spring Boot was chosen for its ease of use and reduced configuration needs, enabling developers to focus on coding. MySQL was selected over CSV files for its robust and scalable data management capabilities. Additionally, a JavaScript frontend framework replaces the original Java Swing, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface across devices.

**Justification for Deviating from the Course Syllabus**

The deviations from the course syllabus are justified for several reasons:

1. **Technological Relevance**: Spring Boot and MySQL reflect current industry practices.
2. **Enhanced Functionality**: The combination of Spring Boot and a JavaScript frontend offers improved scalability and user experience.
3. **Improved Learning Outcomes**: Engaging with these technologies equips developers with valuable skills.

## Project Background & Lineage

This project (**CP2A**) is a direct continuation and enhancement of a previous course project, [cp1](https://github.com/imperionite/cp1), which served as the foundational phase for the MotorPH Employee Management System. The initial phase (cp1) focused on building a RESTful backend using Spring Boot and MySQL, implementing core payroll features such as:

- Employee information management
- Attendance tracking
- Automated payroll calculations
- Basic deductions and salary computation

The rationale, design decisions, and initial API documentation from **cp1** have been carried forward and expanded upon in this repository. Much of the documentation, architectural structure, and core modules in **CP2A** are derived from or inspired by the groundwork established in **cp1**. This ensures architectural consistency and provides a clear evolutionary path for the system.

**For detailed foundational documentation, refer to the [cp1 repository](https://github.com/imperionite/cp1).**  
All essential background, rationale, and initial API endpoint documentation are either included here or referenced directly from cp1 to avoid duplication and ensure clarity.

### Whatâ€™s New in This Project

- **Frontend Integration:** A new React frontend (in the `GUI` folder) using Vite, running independently and communicating with the backend via REST API and CORS.
- **Improved Modularity:** Backend and frontend are decoupled for easier deployment and scalability.
- **Updated Documentation:** Enhanced and updated documentation, with references to class diagrams ([see here](https://github.com/imperionite/cp2a/blob/main/CLASS_DIAGRAM.md)) and new features added in this phase.

## Initial Data Source and Application Setup

The initial data utilized by this application is sourced from the Google Sheets provided in the Phase 1 requirements instruction, accessible via this [link](https://sites.google.com/mmdc.mcl.edu.ph/motorph/home). Specifically, the [Employee](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1168Un_0b5CPDwDSOH4CWI1m8_-2LpLadX3wAdUNNFOo/edit?usp=sharing) database serves as the foundational dataset. The process of seeding data is accomplished through the use of the `ApplicationRunner`.

### Data Seeding and Initial Setup

The application uses an `ApplicationRunner` to seed the database with initial data. This ensures that the application has a basic set of employees and users to start with. The data is prepared in a multi-step process:

1.  **Google Sheets:** Employee and user data is initially sourced in Google Sheets for ease of collaboration and management.
2.  **CSV Export:** This data is then exported from Google Sheets in CSV (Comma Separated Value) format.
3.  **MySQL Import:** The CSV files are then used to populate the MySQL database during application startup using the `ApplicationRunner`. This automated process ensures that the database is consistently populated with the necessary data.

**Rationale:** This approach allows for a flexible and manageable way to maintain and update the initial data. Google Sheets provides a user-friendly interface for data entry and collaboration, while the CSV format serves as a reliable intermediate format for importing into the database. The `ApplicationRunner` automates the import process, ensuring data consistency and reducing manual effort.

## Getting Started

The frontend will run on port 5173 and communicate with the backend via REST API calls with CORS enabled.

### 1. Clone the Project Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imperionite/cp2a.git
cd cp2a
```

### 2. Start the MySQL Database with Docker

Run the following command to start a MySQL 8.0 container for the app database:

```bash
docker run -d --name mysql -p 4306:3306 \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb \
  -e MYSQL_USER=myuser \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypassword \
  -v mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \
  mysql:8.0.40
```

This will expose MySQL on port 4306 with the specified credentials.

### 3. Run the Spring Boot Backend REST API

From the root of the cloned project (where `pom.xml` is located), run:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start the backend server on port 8080. Ensure you have Maven installed and configured in your environment.

### 4. Run the React Frontend

Navigate to the frontend code directory:

```bash
cd GUI
```

Install dependencies (if not already installed):

```bash
yarn install
```

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
